# Gamma Markets - Decentralized E-Commerce Protocol - Powered by Nostr

Building atop the Nostr protocol, the Gamma Markets protocol is designed to perform the complete e-commerce stack in accordance with the Nostr protocol (as outlined in the [NIPs Specification](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/). Specifically, Gamma Markets defines a set of event specifications for each domain of e-commerce, gives examples of their use, and provides a flexible foundation for evolution and expansion of the spec by the developer community.

## Core Commerce Systems Specifications

"Core commerce systems" in e-commerce are the fundamental components that enable an online business to operate smoothly. These systems manage the essential commerce functions, including product management, transactions, and fulfillment. The Gamma Markets protocol provides event specifications for each of these core commerce domains. 

Hereâ€™s a list of the Gamma Market core commerce systems defined in this spec:

- Products (LINK: core_products.md)
- Orders (LINK: core_orders.md)
- Fulfillment (LINK: core_fulfillment.md)

## MIPs 
MIPs stand for __Market Implementation Possibilities__. 

While the Core Commerce Specification defines the foundation of the Gamma Markets Protocol, which ensure maximum interoperability between clients, MIPs define additional features that clients can optionally adopt.
